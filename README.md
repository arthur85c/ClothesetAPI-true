<h2>What is Clothest?</h2><br>
Clothest is an web application that I made that helps Hypebeast keeps track of what items they have in their closet. With Clothest, you can create a virtual cloest that you can bring it on the go and wow others with your collection.

<h2>Planning</h2><br>
For my V1, I would want to have a products table that would get related to each user. For V2, I would want a table where all the resale websites can be listed out. This will not be associated to any one person, anyone who is logged in would be able to add to the list and use the list. V3 would have been a joins table between the products table and the website table. It would be a listing table, for people to keep track of what they are listing their items for.

<h2>User Stories</h2><br>
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account to track all my products.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to change my password to my account in case someone else have figured out my password.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to add new products and have the ability to update and delete said items when ever I want.<br>
- As a user, I want to be able to have the page automatically refresh whenever any changes is made.<br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem solving</h2><br>
- Utilizing puts with every action to determin what each function is putting.<br>
- Utilizing documentation on methods to find different ways of using it in my application.<br>
- Breaking down large issues into more managable issues and solving each one before moving on.<br>
- Constantly commiting changes, so when I mess up, I had a clear commit history to refer back to when lost.<br>
- utilizing the issues queue to solve any problem that I have been stuck on for a while<br>
<hr>
<h2>Adding Features</h2><br>
- Given more time, I would like to add another table that has all the popular resale websites out there.<br>
- Create a third table that would be a joins table of the product table and the website table so I can have listing information.<br>

<h2>Development Process</h2><br>
I underestimated the amount of work that will had to be done to create the back end API. There were several thing that I wasnt familiar with and I had to go back and re-learn it to ensure that I understand it correctly before continuing with my project. But beside that, everything just took longer than expected to implement, which was why I was not able to get to my v2 and v3 iteration of my final project.
